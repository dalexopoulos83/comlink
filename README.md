# comlink
The code on this repo is part of my master thesis on HUA.
I have implement a VLC communication link and here you can find the code for QAM modulation and demodulation in Octave.
Also I have the implementation of the necessary scripts on Octave and SCPI for communication and control of Agilent signal generator and oscillator.
